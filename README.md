# RC-SIT Developers Site

Welcome to the home of the NCSU Research Computing Solutions & Integration Team (RC-SIT).

## Key aspects of Research Computing Solutions and Integration:

* **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Utilizing powerful computing clusters to handle computationally intensive tasks like simulations, modeling, and large-scale data analysis.

* **Data Management Systems**: Secure, scalable storage solutions for managing vast amounts of research data, including data ingestion, organization, and access controls.

* **Data Analysis Tools**: Dashboards for data representation, statistical analysis, visualization, and facilitation of machine learning tailored to specific research disciplines.

* **Cloud Integration**: Leveraging cloud computing platforms for flexible and scalable computing resources, allowing researchers to access processing power on-demand.
* **Network Infrastructure**: High-speed network connections to facilitate fast data transfer between computing systems, research instruments, and collaborators. User Interface and Access Control: User-friendly interfaces for researchers to submit jobs, manage data, and access computing resources with appropriate security measures

Here are some steps of how anyone can create and edit new content in this website.
* The necessary change is carried out in the `_config.yml`.
* If creating a new menu item, the following need to be done.
     - create a `_newdirectory` in the trunk (ncsu-rc-sit).
     - Add the necessary .html template in the `_includes directory`.
     - Create the corresponding markdown template `newtemplate.md` in [`pages`](https://github.com/jtande/ncsu-rc-sit/tree/main/pages) directory.
     - Images to be added could stay in the repository.
