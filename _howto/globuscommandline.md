The Globus CLI, is a standalone application that can be installed on the userâ€™s machine and used to access the Globus service.

## Installing Globus Command Line interface

The tool is a Python package. So, you will need Python, as well as the pip installer installed on your system.
follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.globus.org/cli/installation/) to install it on your system.

### Linux/Unix Environment
Users of *Linux/Unix* distributions only have to install the prerequisites to complete the installation.

### Windows Environment

Computers with Windows operating systems~(OS) older than Windows 10 do not have the Bash shell installed by default.
If you have a Windows OS older than Windows 10, we encourage you to use an emulator included in Git for Windows, which
gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git. Once installed, you can open a terminal by running the program
Git Bash from the Windows start menu.

* *Terminal Emulator*: Download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) with Git Bash.

* *Python Packages* : Follow the instructions from the [Software Carpentry site](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python)
to install Python3 on your windows computer. Use all of the default for installation except make sure to check  
*Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable*

* *Install the Globus CLI*: `pip install --upgrade --user globus-cli`
