Globus Connect Personal (GCP) is the client that users can install on their personal computer to then share data with others. Sometimes, there is a need to share roles on a GCP. For a role sharing to happen, the GCP owners must have a subscription, in this case it would be the NC State Globus Subscription. The steps below will walk you through the process of enabling subscriptions.

Continue to [Globus Web App log in](https://app.globus.org/) to know who you are when you move data between any pair of systems, Globus needs a unique identifier for you, which is called a “Distinguished Name”, or DN. You can generate a DN instantly for free. To create a DN, you need to log in from some authoritative source that can verify your identity, typically your university or employer. If you already have a DN from another source, you can use that. If you do not, you can associate one with your account from many of the major universities in the world via the “CI Logon” service.<br>

 To retrieve your DN, go to [cilogon.org](https://cilogon.org) in your browser. Select an Identity Provider from the drop-down list, and click "Log On" which will take you to the login screen for the Identity Provider you selected. If your university or employer is not in the list, we recommend registering for an [XSEDE account](https://portal.xsede.org/#/guest) as XSEDE is a CILogon Identity Provider.
