<p>The Science DMZ as defined by <a href="https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/">ESnet</a>
is a portion of the network, built at or
near the campus or laboratory’s local network perimeter
that is designed such that the equipment, configuration,
and security policies are optimized for high-performance
scientific applications rather than for general-purpose
business systems or “enterprise” computing.</p>

<p>Data is the object that connect scientists and instruments
within the Science DMZ. The design and set up of the Science
DMZ, limits the number of applications that exposes the  network
to the rest of the world. to this effect, Globus is the application
most in use.</p>

<p>Why Use the Globus Platform?</p>

<p>Globus provides scalable, secure solutions to the research community:</p>

  <li>It enables login using linked external identities; Globus federates
identities from over 150 identity providers including InCommon, Google,
XSEDE and Internet2.</li>
  <li>It allows for the transfer of large datasets fast, securely, and reliably.</li>

<p>The Globus platform is built on widely adopted industry standards such as
OAuth and OpenID Connect for authentication/authorization, and uses trusted
protocols such as GridFTP and HTTPS. We are going to explore the use of Globus
for data transfer as follow:</p>
