This is a respository of the Gate City Research Network (gcrNet)
Information about projects on the gcrNet are published on the
respository web site. Configuration scripts and other setup
recipes are stored in this resposity.

Below is a description of files and directories in the repository:

* 404.html - <br>
The HTTP error 404, or more commonly called "404 error", means that the page you are trying to open could not be found on the server. This is a client-side incident which means either the page has been deleted or moved, and the URL has not been modified accordingly, or that you have misspelled the URL    

* Gemfile - <br>
A Gemfile describes the gem dependencies required to execute associated Ruby code. Place the Gemfile in the root of the directory containing the associated code.

* Gemfile.lock - <br>
The Gemfile.lock file is where Bundler records the exact versions that were installed. This way, when the same library/project is loaded on another machine, running bundle install will look at the Gemfile. ... Running different versions on different machines could lead to broken tests, etc.

* _config.yml - <br>
The main configuration file for the IQ Server installation is a YAML formatted file called config. yml found in the installation directory. The config. yml file typically contains only those configuration options which are rarely changed.
