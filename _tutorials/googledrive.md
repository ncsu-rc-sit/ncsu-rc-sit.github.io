* How to search the end points shared with the user. 
* How to access the end points shared with the user.

* Types of authentications for accessing the end points. 

When a new end point is created for a user, then the user may have to access the end points by following certain steps. <br>

Login to your [globus account](#https://tinyurl.com/wvfyws) in order to access the google drive end point. <br>
Once you login, check the end points. Since it is the first time, click on _**“Shared With You.”**_ <br>
If you could not find the end point, search the endpoint in the search box with your username <br>

Since this is the first time you are trying to access the end point, globus requests for an authentication/Consent from the user.  <br>
In order to continue with the authentication, click on _**“continue.”**_

Click on the email that matches your globus email and follow the steps. If you  are logging in using your institution identity, it validates the credentials and forwards to next steps.

Click on _**Allow**_ if you agree to the terms of service

If the status is changed to **Active**, that means you have granted the permission to access the end point files.
